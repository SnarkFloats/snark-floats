    Welcome to Snark Floats
   </h2>
   <p>
    I‚Äôm not here to hold your hand. This is the place where I drag my own half-drowned thoughts onto a life raft made of sarcasm, sharp humor, and stubborn honesty. And if you want to climb aboard, you‚Äôre welcome. This ain't the Titanic, and I'm not hogging the door.
   </p>
   <p>
    This isn‚Äôt a public service. It‚Äôs survival. <em>My</em> survival. I call bullshit where I see it&mdash;on bad tech, bad storytelling, bad history, corporate evil, and the small stupid things that try to sink us one annoyance at a time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Life‚Äôs a mess. Snark floats.<br />
    Grab a seat if you can handle it. If not, there are plenty of other lifeboats out there padded with Pinterest quotes and toxic positivity. Good luck. You‚Äôll need it.

      <h2>The Cis Chicken Incident: How Political Correctness Murdered My Punchline&mdash;and Almost Killed Empathy Too</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 3, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
        An everyday work meeting. A dancing cartoon turkey. A dumb pun. I almost typed ‚Äúcis chicken.‚Äù I didn't.<br />
        Why? Because fear of being misunderstood and labeled a bigot now outweighs the joke. That's what happens when even the silly gets treated like harm and fear overpowers connection.
