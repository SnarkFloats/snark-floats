    Welcome to Snark Floats
   </h2>
   <p>
    I’m not here to hold your hand. This is the place where I drag my own half-drowned thoughts onto a life raft made of sarcasm, sharp humor, and stubborn honesty — and if you want to climb aboard, you’re welcome.
   </p>
   <p>
    This isn’t a public service. It’s survival. I call bullshit where I see it — on bad tech, bad storytelling, bad history, corporate evil, and the small stupid things that try to sink us all.
   </p>
   <p>
    Life’s a mess. Snark floats. Grab a seat if you can handle it. If not, there are plenty of other lifeboats out there, filled with Pinterest quotes and toxic positivity. Good luck. You’ll need it…

      <h2>OpenAI Built the Ultimate Tool. But Clippy Might Still Win.</h2>

      <p class="card-excerpt">
        OpenAI has built the most powerful AI on the planet, but brilliance alone doesn’t make a great product. Without better UX, memory handling, and real workflow support, ChatGPT risks being outpaced by dumber tools that just work.<br />
        The future of AI shouldn’t belong to Clippy, but without better product thinking, it just might.

        You’re not using AI wrong. You’re just using it like a smart toaster. If you want results beyond warm output and emoji-laden bulleted lists, treat it like a collaborator. Talk to it. Teach it. Trust it. Then watch what happens...
