    <h2>🫀🧠 Shame Doesn't Win Hearts and Minds</h2>
    <p class="card-date">August 7, 2025</p>
    <p class="card-excerpt">
      When we publicly shame the people who made the fatal mistake of voting for Donald Trump (a second time), all we’re doing is reinforcing their commitment. Not necessarily because they still believe every lie he tells, but because it’s psychologically easier to double down than admit you were duped. To admit you were a sucker. Especially when everyone’s pointing and saying, “I told you so.”<br />
     Mockery feels good. I bet change would feel better...

    <h2>🧠 TL;DR &mdash; We Stopped Thinking</h2>
    <p class="card-date">July 29, 2025</p>
    <p class="card-excerpt">
      TL;DR used to mean “too long; didn’t read.” Now it seems to mean “too complicated; didn’t think.”<br />
      If our attention span is shorter than a goldfish’s and we’re letting AI do all our thinking, what’s left of us?<br />
      <br />
      Our obsession with brevity is killing critical thinking &mdash; and we need to fight for the full thought process.

      <p class="card-excerpt">
       For those of you who weren’t around in the Before Times™ &mdash; when pensions were a thing and loyalty actually meant something &mdash; let me break it to you gently:<br />
       It hasn’t always been this broken.<br />
       Today’s corporate system doesn’t just fail to value humans &mdash; it actively punishes companies that try. Stock price didn’t go up this quarter? Cue the layoffs. The system wasn’t built for people.<br />
       It was built for capital.<br />
       And my grandma, who just asked why that’s considered normal, sees through it better than most CEOs ever will.

      <h2>Project Catharsis: How OpenAI Could Turn Frustration Into Function</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 13, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
       OpenAI needs money. Users need a better way to be heard. Project Catharsis is a feature concept that delivers both. It lets ChatGPT users opt in to share rants (or raves) about the brands they already talk about &mdash; while OpenAI turns that raw, emotional data into high-value insights companies will actually pay for. It’s ethical, scalable, and already halfway happening in chat. All it needs now is a name, a toggle, and a team willing to build it.

      <p class="card-excerpt">
        An everyday work meeting. A dancing cartoon turkey. A dumb pun. I almost typed “cis chicken.” I didn't.<br />
        Why? Because fear of being misunderstood and labeled a bigot now outweighs the joke. That's what happens when even the silly gets treated like harm and fear overpowers connection.
