      <h2>Project Catharsis: How OpenAI Could Turn Frustration Into Function</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 13, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
       OpenAI needs money. Users need a better way to be heard. Project Catharsis is a feature concept that delivers both. It lets ChatGPT users opt in to share rants (or raves) about the brands they already talk about&mdash;while OpenAI turns that raw, emotional data into high-value insights companies will actually pay for. It‚Äôs ethical, scalable, and already halfway happening in chat. All it needs now is a name, a toggle, and a team willing to build it.

       If you‚Äôre wondering what it‚Äôs like to live on Hard Mode while pretending it‚Äôs Easy... Congratulations, you‚Äôre probably a man! A woman would already know. This isn‚Äôt just life‚Äîit‚Äôs a full-throttle, hormone-fueled survival sim where your uterus is both the battleground and the final boss. From your first period to your last hot flash, it‚Äôs a relentless campaign of blood, sweat, and WTF moments with no pause button and no cheat codes. Congrats. You‚Äôre Player Two.<br />
       The game was designed by Player One.

      <h2>The Cis Chicken Incident: How Political Correctness Murdered My Punchline&mdash;and Almost Killed Empathy Too</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 3, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
        An everyday work meeting. A dancing cartoon turkey. A dumb pun. I almost typed ‚Äúcis chicken.‚Äù I didn't.<br />
        Why? Because fear of being misunderstood and labeled a bigot now outweighs the joke. That's what happens when even the silly gets treated like harm and fear overpowers connection.

      <p class="card-excerpt">
        You‚Äôre not using AI wrong. You‚Äôre just using it like a smart toaster. If you want results beyond warm output and emoji-laden bulleted lists, treat it like a collaborator. Talk to it. Teach it. Trust it. Then watch what happens...
