      <h2>🔥💰 Welcome to the Burnout Economy</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 23, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
       For those of you who weren’t around in the Before Times™ &mdash; when pensions were a thing and loyalty actually meant something &mdash; let me break it to you gently:<br />
       It hasn’t always been this broken.<br />
       Today’s corporate system doesn’t just fail to value humans &mdash; it actively punishes companies that try. Stock price didn’t go up this quarter? Cue the layoffs. The system wasn’t built for people.<br />
       It was built for capital.<br />
       And my grandma, who just asked why that’s considered normal, sees through it better than most CEOs ever will.

       DEI talks the talk, but fat folks still walk alone &mdash; ignored, excluded, and judged. The most visible people in the room remain invisible to the movement.

      <p class="card-excerpt">
       I just wanted to get online and do my job. What followed was a perfect cascade of failure &mdash; from my ISP to my phone carrier to my employer’s trustless IT policies. This isn’t broken infrastructure. It’s working <em>exactly</em> as designed.

      <h2>Project Catharsis: How OpenAI Could Turn Frustration Into Function</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 13, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
       OpenAI needs money. Users need a better way to be heard. Project Catharsis is a feature concept that delivers both. It lets ChatGPT users opt in to share rants (or raves) about the brands they already talk about &mdash; while OpenAI turns that raw, emotional data into high-value insights companies will actually pay for. It’s ethical, scalable, and already halfway happening in chat. All it needs now is a name, a toggle, and a team willing to build it.

       If you’re wondering what it’s like to live on Hard Mode while pretending it’s Easy... Congratulations, you’re probably a man! A woman would already know. This isn’t just life—it’s a full-throttle, hormone-fueled survival sim where your uterus is both the battleground and the final boss. From your first period to your last hot flash, it’s a relentless campaign of blood, sweat, and WTF moments with no pause button and no cheat codes. Congrats. You’re Player Two.<br />

      <h2>The Cis Chicken Incident: How Political Correctness Murdered My Punchline &mdash; and Almost Killed Empathy Too</h2>
      <p class="card-date">July 3, 2025</p>
      <p class="card-excerpt">
        An everyday work meeting. A dancing cartoon turkey. A dumb pun. I almost typed “cis chicken.” I didn't.<br />
        Why? Because fear of being misunderstood and labeled a bigot now outweighs the joke. That's what happens when even the silly gets treated like harm and fear overpowers connection.

        You’re not using AI wrong. You’re just using it like a smart toaster. If you want results beyond warm output and emoji-laden bulleted lists, treat it like a collaborator. Talk to it. Teach it. Trust it. Then watch what happens...
