<h1>🫵 What Ever Happened to Just Being Yourself?<br />Because “Likes” Aren’t the Same as Connection</h1>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>TL;DR</summary>
<ul>
  <li>🐹 Social media is <strong>engineered for addiction</strong>, not connection. It's not your fault you get stuck scrolling &mdash; <em>it's by design</em>.</li>
  <li>🧠 <strong>Captology is real</strong> &mdash; an entire field of study dedicated to how tech shapes your behavior without you realizing it.</li>
  <li>💡 Being liked isn’t the same as being understood. Metrics give you a sugar rush, not real nourishment.</li>
  <li>🧍‍♀️ “Personal branding” often means turning yourself into a product. That’s exhausting. You’re a person, not a pitch deck.</li>
  <li>🪞 When you know yourself, you don’t need the numbers. External validation becomes extra &mdash; not your foundation.</li>
  <li>🔒 The algorithm will sell you a shinier, more “marketable” version of yourself, but it’s also a weaker one, built on approval.</li>
  <li>✊ Real authenticity isn’t optimized. It’s messy, complicated, and human. And it should be enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other day, I posted something on LinkedIn that I didn’t expect to go viral. And it didn’t.<br />
Shocker!</p>
<p>But for once, the post wasn’t completely swallowed by the void, which is what usually happens on the extremely rare occasions I deign to post on LinkedIn. (I consider it a toxic “look at me” dump for professional wannabes, in my ever-so-humble opinion.)</p>
<p>A couple people actually responded &mdash; not with memes or fire emojis, but with thoughts. Ideas. Agreement. A tiny glimmer of connection.</p>
<p>1049 impressions. 642 people reached. 15 profile views. 15 reactions. 3 comments (one of them my response).</p>
<p>Not exactly chart-topping numbers, I know. But my reaction to watching those numbers rise? That got me thinking.<br />
And I realized:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, this is what I thought social media would be.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back when social media was first pitched to us &mdash; wide-eyed, hopeful, pre-Zuckerberg naifs that we were &mdash; the idea we bought into was connection.</p>
<p>We were going to share ideas. Meet people. Create communities. Trade perspectives with strangers who were passionate and weird in the best possible ways. Sometimes strangers just like us.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the line, it all shifted.</p>
<p>Now? The platforms push engagement above everything. The only metrics that matter are:<br />
“How many eyeballs saw this?”<br />
“How many of them tapped a button?”<br />
And of course, most importantly, “How much money can we make off their time and attention?”</p>
<p>The dopamine loop is real. We all feel that rush when the numbers go up. We’re being seen! We’re being heard! And gosh darn it, people like us!</p>
<p>But that feeling? It’s a sugar rush, not real nourishment.<br />
And if you chase it long enough, you can forget what actual connection even tastes like.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🤷‍♀️ I Don’t Want to Be a Brand. Why Can’t I Just Be a Person?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of noise out there about “building your personal brand.”<br />
But what that really seems to mean, most of the time, is: curate yourself into a product.</p>
<p>Be consistent. Be polished. Be strategic. Be interesting.<br />
Never contradict yourself. Never evolve. Never offend.<br />
Be a motivational poster &mdash; but make sure it‘s marketable. Impress people.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>I have no desire to be a Canva template with a canned voice. And I can’t imagine most of you reading this want that either.</p>
<p>I’d rather be a person with a fully developed personality that doesn’t fit easily into an elevator pitch or a meme. Even if that means saying something messy, complicated, offensive &mdash; or (gasp) human.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🧘‍♀️ I Know Myself. I Like Myself. And That Took Work.</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing:<br />
I didn’t always know who I was or who I wanted to be. I didn’t always like myself.</p>
<p>I spent decades questioning what was wrong with me, what I should be doing differently, and why not everyone liked me.</p>
<p>But now? I know myself pretty damn well. And I do like myself. Quite a lot, actually.<br />
Not in a performative way.<br />
Not in a “here’s a photo of me journaling thoughtfully  in a cabin with a branded mug” kind of way.<br />
Not in a way anyone would probably recognize from the outside.</p>
<p>But in a quiet, stubborn, honest way. In a way I worked damn hard to achieve.<br />
And I think <em>that</em> makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Because when you know who you are &mdash; and you like that person &mdash; you don’t need the numbers to validate you. The numbers? They’re just gravy.</p>
<p>You can enjoy a few likes without pretending it’s proof of worth.<br />
You can post something and not spiral if it flops, or if not everyone agrees with you.<br />
You can speak your truth without tailoring it to please the feed.</p>
<p>It’s still your truth.<br />
Sometimes, it’s still <em>the truth</em>.</p>

<h3>SNARKY SIDEBAR</h3></p>
<p><strong>Captology. It’s a Real Word! And Here’s Why You Should Learn It...</strong></p>
<p>There’s an entire field called <strong>captology</strong> &mdash; short for Computers as Persuasive Technology.</p>
<p>It sounds made up. It’s not.</p>
<p>It’s the academic study of how digital systems are <em>designed</em> to shape your behavior. It’s such a common phenomenon that there’s an academic study around it. Think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>And social media? It’s captology’s <em>final boss fight</em>.</p>
<p>Every feature &mdash; from infinite scroll to notification dings to streaks to “someone is typing...” bubbles &mdash; is built to lock in your focus and keep you hooked.</p>
<p>These platforms don’t want to inform, connect, or uplift humanity.<br />
They want your time. Your attention. Your clicks. Your data. Your habits.<br />
They want to <em>train you</em>.</p>
<p>Social media is <em>designed to be addicting</em>. Every aspect of it is engineered to keep you coming back.</p>
<p>And they’ll do <em>damn near anything</em> to make that happen, because the longer you stay, the more they profit.</p>
<p>So if you’ve ever felt like you’re losing time, energy, or your sense of self in the scroll...<br />
If you’ve ever found yourself refreshing just to see the numbers tick up...<br />
You’re not broken.</p>
<p>The system is doing <em>exactly</em> what it was built to do. And it’s hoping you’ll blame <em>yourself</em> for it.</p>
</div>
<br />
<hr />
<p>I’m not saying the numbers don’t feel good sometimes. I’m certainly not above enjoying a solid reaction count.<br />
I like feeling heard as much as the next gal.</p>
<p>But I don’t need it to like myself. And I refuse to trade my authenticity for attention &mdash; or perform for strangers just to get their approval.</p>
<p>So if the platform rewards me for being me? Cool.<br />
If it doesn’t?<br />
That’s okay too. It just means I’m not feeding the machine.</p>
<p>(That’s not to say you shouldn’t like or comment if you feel like it. 😜)</p>
<hr />
<h2>🤔 Final Thought: Know Who You Are First</h2>
<p>If you take anything from this post, take this:</p>
<p><strong>Know your damn self first.</strong></p>
<p>Before the numbers.<br />
  Before the feedback.<br />
  Before the platform tries to tell you who to be.</p>
<p>Because if you don’t know who you are, the algorithm will happily sell you a shinier, more “marketable” version of yourself. More polished. More palatable. More fake. And maybe most importantly, a <em>weaker</em> version that needs that outside approval to feel whole.</p>
<p>Once you buy into that, it’s damn hard to come back.</p>
<p>But if you do know yourself &mdash; <em>really</em> know yourself?</p>
<p>You’re already ahead of the game.</p>
