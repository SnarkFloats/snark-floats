<h1>🛠️ Broken by Design. Silenced by Intent.</h1>
<h2><em>To a platform like LinkedIn, not conforming reads as nonexistence. If you don’t match the pattern, you’re not a person.</em></h2>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>TL;DR: This time, the system fought back.</summary>
<ul>
  <li>🕵️‍♀️ <strong>Pseudonym with Principles:</strong> I created a separate LinkedIn profile to speak freely without risking my job and played by every one of their rules.</li>
  <li>🧠 <strong>Too Intentional to Tolerate:</strong> I posted a respectful, insightful critique of tech systems and user-hostile design. Real humans responded. The algorithm did not approve.</li>
  <li>🚫 <strong>Locked Out, Shut Down:</strong> Without warning, LinkedIn froze the account and demanded identity verification I never agreed to provide. No login, no appeal, no voice.</li>
  <li>🧱 <strong>The Pattern Problem:</strong> I didn’t get silenced for breaking rules. I got silenced for not matching their expected user archetype. The algorithm couldn’t classify me, so it ejected me.</li>
  <li>🔇 <strong>Systemic Erasure by Design:</strong> Platforms like LinkedIn reward safe, self-promotional content and quietly erase anything that questions the foundation. If you don’t fit the pattern, you don’t exist.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="post-body">
  <p>A few days ago, I wrote about how the system failed me. By working exactly as it was designed to.<br />
 👉 <a href="broken-system.html">The System Isn’t Broken—It’s Just Designed to Break You</a></p>
  <p>That post was about cascading tech failures, user-hostile infrastructure, and what happens when you just try to connect to the internet and the system responds like you’re the problem.</p>
  <p>Well. The system responded again. This time, with tighter precision.</p>
  <p>I didn't post self-promoting but ultimately inconsequential workplace theater, so I didn't fit the pattern.</p>
  <p>I didn’t match the inputs they’ve optimized for, so the algorithm couldn’t classify me.</p>
  <p>And when the system can’t classify you, it doesn’t pause. It ejects.</p>
  <p>This time, <em>it shut me down</em>.</p>
  <hr />
 <h3>🧰 The Setup</h3>
  <p>After writing that post, I decided to share it on LinkedIn. Not under my real name, because… Let’s be honest, I like being employed. But under a pseudonym I’d created specifically for this kind of commentary: honest, incisive, thoughtful, not career-ending.</p>
  <p>The post was well within LinkedIn’s content boundaries. No profanity. No harassment. No conspiracy theories. Just a real-world case study of what happens when every system in your life &mdash; your ISP, your phone provider, your employer’s security tools &mdash; collides in a perfect storm of user failure by design.</p>
  <p>And for a brief moment, it worked. A stranger reacted. Another commented. Real human beings saw the post, read it, and said something like: “This is exactly why user experience should come before what’s convenient for a company.”</p>
  <p>A couple of people heard me. One would’ve been enough.</p>
  <p>Let’s be clear: I didn’t go rogue.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>I played by their rules.</li>
      <li>I used a real email address tied to my blog.</li>
      <li>I gave them a real phone number and jumped through the ‘not a robot’ hoop.</li>
      <li>I disclosed, right on the profile, that Jenifer Jorgenson was a pseudonym.</li>
      <li>I wasn’t impersonating anyone. I wasn’t hiding. I was just trying to speak freely. Without risking my job.</li>
      <li>I followed groups that matched my topics: tech, user experience, product design, writing.</li>
      <li>I engaged respectfully with other people’s posts.</li>
      <li>I didn’t post spam. I didn’t sell anything. I didn’t scream into the void.</li>
      <li>I didn’t even openly disdain LinkedIn itself (or its evil Microsoft overlords).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The algorithm expects smiles. Optimism. Clear career trajectories.<br />
  It expects a real name tied to a corporate title, a polished headshot, and a headline about driving growth.</p>
  <p>It expects career-adjacent performances.</p>
  <p>What it got instead was a pseudonym with a blog, a snarky balloon, and a post about how the system is designed to break people.</p>
  <p>That didn’t compute.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🔒 The Lockout Loop</h3>
  <p>LinkedIn locked me out of the account.<br />
  No warning. No email. No explanation.</p>
  <p>Just a loop of demands: verify your identity, upload a government-issued ID, now download our app, now try again. Now... nothing.</p>
  <p>I gave them an email address. A phone number. I passed their little “prove you’re human” test.<br />
  That wasn’t enough.</p>
  <p>And here’s the catch:<br />
  You can’t appeal unless you’re logged in.<br />
  But you can’t log in unless you verify.</p>
  <p>And every path to verification demands one of two things: a real-world credential. A government-issued ID. Or a corporate email address. Something that proves I belong in their system, their way.</p>
  <p>No ID? No login.<br />
  No login? No appeal.<br />
  No appeal? No voice.</p>
  <p>I even have the screenshot. Because of course I do...<br />
  <img alt="Screenshot of LinkedIn account suspension page" style="maxwidth: 450px" src="../images/posts/broken-design-silent-2.png"/><br />
  <em>LinkedIn's identity verification loop. No login, no appeal. Just silence unless you hand over your real-world credentials.</em></p>
  <p>This wasn’t about “safety.” It wasn’t about “trust.”<br />
  It was about control.</p>
  <p>And yes, I know LinkedIn is a private platform. This isn’t a First Amendment issue.<br />
  But it <em>is</em> a message. A bright, cold one:<br />
  <strong>If you don’t fit the pattern, you don’t get to participate.</strong></p>
  <p>Be a brand. Be a resume. Be a smiling avatar with a leadership quote.<br />
  <p>But don’t be a pseudonym. Don’t be thoughtful and anonymous. Don’t sound human and critical.<br />
  Don't be a real person.</p>
  <p>Because if you don’t behave like the system expects, it doesn’t just ignore you.<br />
  It erases you.</p>
  <p>Remember the days when the Internet offered anonymity?<br />
  Not anymore.<br />
  Now it's pay to play.<br />
  And the payment is your identity, or your money. Or both.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>🧩 The Pattern</h3>
  <p>Let’s be clear: I didn’t get flagged for hate speech. I didn’t violate community guidelines. I didn’t post misinformation or encourage harassment. I told the truth about how our systems can fail us. And I’ll admit, I told it with teeth.</p>
  <p>But this isn’t really about what I said. It’s about how I said it.<br />
  More importantly, it’s about who they thought I was. Or more significantly, that they couldn’t figure out who I was.</p>
  <p>Their systems couldn’t decide what box to put me in.<br />
  And instead of asking questions, it shut the box.</p>
  <p>LinkedIn responded exactly as you’d expect from a platform designed to reward inoffensive self-promotion and suppress anything that might make a corporate brand nervous. Anything that doesn’t encourage more use of the platform itself.</p>
  <p>You’re allowed to fail on LinkedIn. You’re even allowed to whine about it. So long as it’s framed as a learning experience and ends with a personal branding lesson. So long as it encourages someone else to keep using the system.</p>
  <p>But if you analyze the failure?<br />
  If you point out how it was engineered?<br />
  If you dare to say that maybe the system wants you to feel powerless?</p>
  <p>Maybe that’s a little too close to dangerous.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>💬 The Message</h2>
  <p>I wasn’t silenced because I broke the rules.<br />
  I was silenced because I refused to speak within them the way they expected me to.</p>
  <p>That’s the design.</p>
  <p>Compliance is rewarded.<br />
  Critique is filtered.<br />
  Not following the herd?<br />
  The system gods flagged an anomaly.</p>
  <p>Cue the internal alarm: <em>Danger, Will Robinson!</em></p>
  <p>And if you still try to open your  mouth? The system will ask you to hold up your government ID like a digital boarding pass and smile politely while it decides whether or not you qualify as a real boy.</p>
  <p>Broken by design.<br />
  Silenced by intent.</p>
  <p>Because if you don’t match the pattern, you’re not a person.</p>
