<h1>🛠️ The System Isn’t Broken &mdash;<br /> It’s Just Designed to Screw You</h1>
<h2>A real-life case study in tech failures, corporate apathy, and the fragile illusion of control</h2>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>TL;DR: A Perfectly Engineered Failure Spiral</summary>
<ul>
  <li>💀 No Internet, No Warning: Sparklight ghosted me like a bad date &mdash; no alerts, no ETA, just digital tumbleweeds.</li>
  <li>📵 Verizon Loyalty Tax: My “unlimited” plan doesn’t include the right to actually use it &mdash; unless I pay again for the privilege.</li>
  <li>🚨 Backup Plan? Also Screwed: Everyone else’s network was down too. Dial-up in cosplay is not a solution.</li>
  <li>🔌 Tethering Is a Myth: Wireless is the future &mdash; until you need it. No cable, no install rights, no chance.</li>
  <li>🔒 Corporate IT: Trust No One: Locked-down devices, surveillance demands, and a policy straight out of 1984.</li>
  <li>🧩 This Isn’t an Outage. It’s a System: Every part of this mess is working exactly as designed &mdash; to control, extract, and blame you when it fails.</li>
  <li>🫥 The Illusion of Control: You don’t own your tools, your access, or your autonomy. You're just renting privileges until they revoke them.</li>
  <li>🔥 Conclusion? Be Angry: You’re not crazy. You’re not alone. And you’re not the problem. The system isn’t broken &mdash; it’s hostile by design.</li>

  <p>Let me walk you through a real life modern day horror story. It started with a simple goal: I just wanted to connect my laptop to the internet so I could do my job. That’s it. Nothing fancy. No criminal masterminding. No black hat hacking. Just boring old remote work like I do every weekday (and more weekends than I care to adknowledge).</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, I live in the year of our broken tech overlords 2025, where “just connect to the internet” is apparently asking too much of the overpaid failure machines running our infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Here’s what happened.</p>
 <h3>1. Sparklight: Masters of Silence</h3>
  <p>My internet provider, Sparklight, went down. No warning, no alert, not even a sad emoji to let me know they’d tripped over the metaphorical power cord. This, despite them constantly nagging me to sign up for notifications.<br />
    Spoiler: I did. It didn’t help. No notification EVER came.</p>
  <p>I tried their live chat &mdash; no response.<br />
    I called &mdash; first six attempts were met with, and I quote, “technical difficulties.”</p>
  <p> Finally, after mashing buttons and sacrificing what remained of my sanity, a recorded message acknowledged there was an outage in my area. No ETA. Just vibes.</p>
  <h3>2. Verizon: Loyal Customers Get Less</h3>
  <p>Fine. No problem. I’ve got a smartphone. I’ll use my mobile hotspot like a contemporary adult.</p>
  <p>But surprise! Verizon &mdash; my carrier for over 25 years &mdash; has decided that despite my $70+ monthly bill, my long-term loyalty, my on-time payments, and my general not-being-a-criminal, I don’t get to use the hotspot feature.</p>
  <p>You know, unless I pay even more.<br />
     For the privilege of using the data I already pay for.<br />
     On a plan they marketed as “unlimited.”<br />
     It's like buying a sandwich and getting charged extra for the bread.</p>
  <p>I even tried using my Mom’s phone instead. Verizon redirected us to their website to set it up... A website that, of course, wouldn’t load.</p>
  <p>Truly, this was the full customer experience.</p>
  <h3>3. My Backup Backup Plan? On Fire Too.</h3>
  <p> Out of desperation, I checked with my brother on the other side of town, thinking maybe I could hang out there for the day.<br />
   Guess what? His internet was also down. The entire town was down.</p>
  <p>He’s limping along on his own hotspot, but it’s like drinking data through a coffee stirrer. Everyone else in his neighborhood is doing the same, and it’s basically dial-up in cosplay.</p>
    <p>ARGH!</p>
  <h3>4. The Laptop of Shame</h3>
  <p>So I pivot. Could I maybe USB tether? No, because I don’t even own a USB cable anymore. Because I live in the future and everything is wireless &mdash; until it's not.</p>
  <p>Even if I did have one, I’d need to install software to get it working. On my locked-down corporate laptop.</p>
  <p>And that brings us to the final boss of this failure gauntlet:</p>
  <h3>5. My Employer: Where Trust Goes to Die</h3>
  <p>I’ve worked for the same company on and off since 1999. Longer than some of my coworkers have been alive. I’ve never once caused a security incident or been in trouble for any reason. I am, by all definitions, a good and reliable employee.</p>
  <p>But my employer doesn’t trust me. Not even enough to let me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Install a safe, temporary workaround.</li>
      <li> Use a personal device to access work tools.</li>
      <li> Connect from anywhere outside the fortress of their surveillance bubble.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Oh, they offer an option:</p>
    <ul><em>“Just install this profile on your personal phone so we can monitor and wipe it whenever we like!”</em></ul>
  <p>Absolutely not.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>🚨 What This Really Means</h2>
  <p>This isn’t just a bad day. I mean, it WAS a bad day. But it's more than that. It’s a systemic failure across every layer of modern life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> ISPs that can’t communicate.</li>
      <li> Carriers that punish or ignore loyalty.</li>
      <li> Employers that confuse control with security.</li>
      <li> Tech ecosystems that demand total obedience for basic functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Everything is interconnected &mdash; and every part of the system is built to serve itself, not the person caught in the middle.</p>
  <p>You’re allowed to pay. You’re allowed to obey. You’re not allowed to work around a failure. Because if you could? You’d stop needing them.</p>
  <p>You'd stop <strong>paying</strong> them.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>🕹️ The Illusion of Control</h2>
  <p>We live in a world where your data, your devices, your access—none of it is really yours.<br />
   You’re just renting the right to use it under very specific conditions, most of which boil down to:</p>
  <ul><em>“Don’t try to do anything we didn’t explicitly think of, approve, or monetize.”</em></ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>❓ What’s Left?</h2>
  <p>Honestly? Mostly rage.<br />
   And the realization that competent, well-meaning people are constantly being throttled by the very systems they rely on.</p>
  <p>It’s exhausting. It’s demoralizing. It's disenfranchising. And it’s <em>not your fault</em>.</p>
  <p>So no, I’m not sorry for being angry. I’m tired of pretending this is normal.</p>
  <p>If we don’t say it out loud, they’ll just keep calling it “customer-first” or “zero trust security” while gaslighting us into compliance.</p>
  <p>The system <strong>isn't</strong> broken.<br />
 It’s working exactly as intended.<br />
 And it’s time to stop pretending that’s okay.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Also... just fyi. I got paid for a day where I couldn't work. So maybe it's not <em>all</em> bad.</p>
