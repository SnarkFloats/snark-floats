            <h2>Where OpenAI Is Already Ahead of the Game</h2>
            <p>OpenAI isnâ€™t rushing to IPO. Itâ€™s iterating fast, keeping its core product ahead of the curve, and setting the tone for what AI is â€” and what it isnâ€™t. Thatâ€™s the good news.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Best AI Doesnâ€™t Win. The Best Product Does.</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT wonâ€™t fail because it isnâ€™t smart enough. It will fail if it becomes too frustrating to use. Thatâ€™s not a model issue â€” itâ€™s a product one. People donâ€™t abandon tools because theyâ€™re dumb. They abandon them because theyâ€™re annoying.</p>
            <p>And right now, ChatGPT is annoying. It forgets things. It lies about what files youâ€™ve uploaded. It doesnâ€™t let you manage memory. Its UI is clean but not functional. Thereâ€™s no real workflow support. And for the most expensive tier, it has the least intuitive permission structure imaginable.</p>
            <p>This isnâ€™t just an inconvenience. Itâ€™s a product management emergency.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Memory Isnâ€™t Just a Feature â€” Itâ€™s the Foundation</h2>
            <p>The idea that you can have long-term memory on one device but not another is bananas. The idea that you canâ€™t turn off memory for certain threads â€” or export and reload it â€” is even worse. ChatGPT should let users:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pause or disable memory thread by thread</li>
              <li>Preview what it remembers and correct it</li>
              <li>Download, duplicate, or share memory sets</li>
              <li>Toggle between memories the same way you toggle between profiles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Memory should be modular. Transparent. Customizable. And, for the love of everything sacred in UX, not hidden behind vague tooltips and deep navigation clicks.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>File Handling Needs a Rethink</h2>
            <p>Users should be able to see all uploaded files in a sidebar, rename them, remove them, and toggle visibility across threads. Right now, youâ€™re stuck with cryptic links and no control.</p>
            <p>This is not acceptable in a product marketed toward professionals and knowledge workers. It's not even acceptable in a free beta tool anymore.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>UX Isnâ€™t Just About Looks</h2>
            <p>The UI is beautiful. But itâ€™s also hiding vital functionality. Where are the keyboard shortcuts? Whereâ€™s the breadcrumb view of conversation flow? Whereâ€™s the actual workflow support?</p>
            <p>The people who want to use GPTs as assistants arenâ€™t casual browsers â€” theyâ€™re power users. And those users are not going to stick around for long if basic functionality keeps getting buried or broken.</p>
          </section>
        </div>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h3>ðŸ’¸ $20 â†’ $200?! Thatâ€™s Not Pricing â€” Thatâ€™s Ludicrous Speed</h3>
          <p>The leap from $20 to $200/month is not just steep, itâ€™s absurd. Thatâ€™s a 10x jump with no middle tier, no feature scaling, and no nod to solo users or lean teams.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most users donâ€™t need enterprise â€” just advanced.</li>
            <li>Most orgs wonâ€™t pay $200/head for a still-developing tool.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not at all clear what weâ€™re getting thatâ€™s worth 10x as much.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most users donâ€™t need a seat at the boardroom table; they just want a better seat in their kitchen.</p>
