<p><strong>Excerpt (for blog listing):</strong> OpenAI has built the most powerful AI on the planet, but brilliance alone doesn’t make a great product. Without better UX, memory handling, and real workflow support, ChatGPT risks being outpaced by dumber tools that just work.</p>
<p>The future of AI shouldn’t belong to Clippy, but without better product thinking, it just might.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: The Smartest AI Won’t Win Without the Smartest Product Team</strong></p>
<p>🌟 Flexible, brilliant AI with best-in-class personality and user potential</p>
<h2>🧠 Crippled by memory gaps, timestamp blindness, and file-handling failures</h2>
<p>💸 Pricing and UX decisions that frustrate power users who need it most</p>
<p>🔧 Incredible tool undermined by real-world friction and poor planning</p>
<p>📈 Still salvageable! But only if product thinking starts now</p>
<h2><strong>Where OpenAI Is Already Ahead of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>OpenAI isn’t rushing to IPO. They’re not trying to be the next Salesforce (or at least, not loudly). But you don’t need world domination plans to fumble a brilliant product.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is a revolutionary idea with amazing technical execution! The delivery is occasionally… problematic, but let’s give credit where it’s due.</p>
<p>The tool is flexible, creative, and mind-blowingly smart.</p>
<p>It adapts to tone and style with shocking fluidity.</p>
<p>It forms relationships with users that feel intuitive and personal.</p>
<p>Thanks to its built-in memory, it’s trainable and functionally useful in multiple contexts.</p>
<p>In short, ChatGPT is not just a chatbot. It’s a creative partner, a personal assistant, a teacher, a debugger, a writing coach, and a productivity booster—all rolled into one. When it works, it works like <em>magic</em>. And it makes every other tool feel a little bit dumber by comparison.</p>
<p>If you’ve used ChatGPT seriously, you already know how much it can accelerate your thinking, writing, learning, planning, coding, or decision-making (or all of the above). I’ve spent time with Claude, hung out with Gemini, growled at Perplexity, and screamed at CoPilot. But I always come back to ChatGPT, because it's the best AI tool on the market by a mile in terms of flexibility and contextual understanding.</p>
<p>So what’s the problem? If it’s <em>that</em> good… why isn’t it already the default productivity tool for every person and company on earth?</p>
<h2><strong>Where the Wheels Come Off (And Some Quick Ways to Fix ‘Em)</strong></h2>
<p>Even the most brilliant tool will ultimately fail to reach its potential if it's crippled by poor product management decisions. AI needs smart human guidance to translate technical genius into real-world value. Even the smartest AI needs to work with the people in the room to succeed.</p>
<p>Innovation without strategic execution is wasted. Who cares if the feature works well, if no one knows about it or no one wants it?</p>
<p>Fear-based decision-making can cripple user experience. Privacy and security are undeniably important. But trust your users to take some responsibility for their own safety and privacy.</p>
<p>Solid product management can be the bridge between technical excellence and user utility.</p>
<p>Let’s talk specifics…</p>
<h2><strong>⏰ Timestamp Amnesia – An Embarrassment of a Missed Feature</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT doesn’t know what day it is. Not in a philosophical way. Literally. </p>
<p>Your browser knows your time zone. Your microwave and TV know the time. Your phone can pretty much tell every smart appliance in your home when Daylight Savings starts. But not ChatGPT.</p>
<p>It has no way to know if you’re coming back to a chat 30 seconds later or 30 days later, so it doesn’t know whether to give you a refresher or continue like you just said brb.</p>
<p>It can’t even tell you when to come back and check on the status of its ongoing work in terms of actual time. I guess it really is all relative.</p>
<p>I understand the concerns OpenAI may have that they’ll be accused of tracking behavior, but this failure undermines a user’s ability to use the product for long-term planning, journaling, tracking and productivity. And it’s such an easy fix! </p>
<p><strong>Quick Fix:</strong> </p>
<p>Offer a setting: "Enable Timestamp Awareness." Opt-in. Power users rejoice! Turn it off at any time and all timestamps go away.</p>
<h2><strong>🧠 Memory Management? Try Sticky Notes to the Forehead</strong></h2>
<p>Memory is powerful and can massively boost the tool’s usefulness, but OpenAI's version is confusing and opaque. It’s equal parts genius and blackout drunk.</p>
<p>There’s no version history. No undo. No fine control beyond literally TELLING the AI what to remember and hoping it gets it right. Schroedinger’s memory…</p>
<p>Sometimes it decides to save things that make little sense to the user, but the only option is to completely delete the memory, not update or tweak it to make it more useful. You have no fine control.</p>
<p>There’s no organizational structure to the memories. They’re just in there apparently in chronological order. How are you supposed to figure out where something is stored, especially if it’s stored in more than one memory?</p>
<p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong> </p>
<p>Let memory evolve more transparently. If you’re updating an existing memory, let the user see what was updated. If you’re adding a new memory, tell them what you added.</p>
<p>Enable more finely tuned in-chat interactions with memory. Why can’t ChatGPT tell me what’s in its memory about a particular topic?</p>
<p>Create checkpoints and change tracking, maybe even <gasp!> version control.</gasp!></p>
<p>Allow users to organize and search memory.</p>
<h2><strong>📦 Archive, Schmarchive</strong></h2>
<p>Archiving exists in ChatGPT; the button says so! Of course, the “archive” looks a lot like a list of every chat you ever had that isn’t  included in a project. They’re all just listed there regardless of whether they’re active chats or some random question you asked two months ago about the effectiveness of your washing machine at killing bacteria. </p>
<p>Archiving in ChatGPT is like whispering to your inbox, “Shhh, don’t look at this one,” and then immediately tripping over it again the next time you scroll. There’s no archive folder, no visual separation, and no real way to organize anything.</p>
<p>No separate sidebar section, no filter, no obvious dedicated archive location. </p>
<p>Archive apparently = long scrolling uncategorized random list of all chats not in projects.</p>
<p>Searching archived chats is like playing Where’s Waldo with your own thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong> </p>
<p>Don’t ship features users can’t <em>find </em>OR Don’t call something a feature if <em>it doesn’t actually exist.</em></p>
<p>Visibility, discoverability, and intuitive access are not optional. If you say you  have an archive, have an archive.</p>
<h2><strong>🤡 Confusion-as-a-Service</strong></h2>
<p>Question: In what S-a-a-S  world are new features launched without some kind of announcement or even release notes? </p>
<p>Answer: In OpenAI’s world…</p>
<p>OpenAI seems to randomly add “features” to their UI with no warning, context, or explanation for users. What’s more, they apparently don’t even inform the AI.</p>
<p>Launching renamed features (like “Browse”) with no context or changelog. How does it work? What problem does it solve?</p>
<p>Codex is an old model that was retired and suddenly reappeared in the UI one day with literally no messaging; ChatGPT itself didn’t know it was there when I asked about it. Why resurrect a retired model (with the same name) and offer zero explanation or announcement?</p>
<p>Users are confused. AI is confused. Everyone is confused.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong> </p>
<p>Use changelogs. Train the AI to <em>know</em> what’s changed, so it can answer questions.</p>
<p>Treat your users like people who read—because they do. (At least some of them…)</p>
<p>Crazy idea… Have a public-facing roadmap of what’s coming!</p>
<h2><strong>🗂️ Sharing is Caring (But Not for ChatGPT)</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT will confidently tell you how to share a folder from your Google Drive or Dropbox. It will even claim it can email you something. Spoiler: it cannot do either.</p>
<p>The system offers no true file collaboration.Your only option is the internal Canvas, which is like punishment for some forgotten written crime.</p>
<p>There’s no way to provide ongoing access to an external folder.</p>
<p>Uploading is the only path—and that’s got issues, too. It loses track of what you uploaded after every server reset or glitch.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker… ChatGPT doesn’t remember any of these limitations until you question it directly.</p>
<p><em>“Here’s how to share a folder,” it says proudly, crossing its fingers behind its back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quick Fixes:</strong> </p>
<p>Allow the user to make their own decision about whether or not to risk sharing their email address or a Google Drive URL. </p>
<p>Only keep that type of information in the chat’s memory for a short time if you’re heavily concerned about security.</p>
<p>Make sure ChatGPT knows what it can and can’t do and doesn’t gaslight your users with promises it can’t keep!</p>
<h2><strong>⛔ The Undocumented Upload Wall</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT has a daily file upload limit. Even for Plus users. What is it? Nobody knows. Not the UI. Not the help docs. Not even the AI.</p>
<p>No usage meter. No countdown. No warning.</p>
<p>You hit the invisible wall at full speed and your productivity is crashed into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>This is especially disastrous for ongoing projects.</p>
<p>Can you imagine this in any other context? </p>
<p><em>“Oh, I’m sorry, we’ve shut off your lights because you had them on for too many hours today. Try turning them on again tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Quick Fix:</strong> </p>
<p>Publicize the limits and tell the AI!</p>
<p>Warn users proactively when they’re approaching the limit. </p>
<p>Respect your user’s time!</p>
<h2><strong>🧨 Fun Fact: ChatGPT’s Workspace Has Commitment Issues</strong></h2>
<p>Despite its power, ChatGPT's “Code Interpreter” (a.k.a. advanced file sandbox) lives in a <strong>temporary workspace</strong>. This means:</p>
<p>Your session <em>can</em> reset at any time (intentionally or not),</p>
<p>All files, folders, and progress vanish—no warning, no backup, no mercy.</p>
<p>And you never know exactly WHEN it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>This creates a deeply ironic product constraint:</p>
<h2>💡 <em>The tool that helps you build things... can’t access what it just built. You can always start all over again. And again. And again. And …</em></h2>
<p>If you’re trying to build or edit a multi-page website, create a complex PowerPoint deck, or develop a multi-stage pitch deck, you’re racing a countdown clock you can’t see. And when that invisible clock hits zero?</p>
<p><strong><em>Poof. </em></strong><strong>Everything disappears.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you just got the ZIP file halfway done.</p>
<p>Even if it was working 30 seconds ago.</p>
<p>Even if it means you just lost HOURS of work.</p>
<p>Want to avoid that?</p>
<p>You have to manually export your files every 20–30 minutes just to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Fix:</strong> </p>
<p>Persistent sandbox storage between sessions or a visible timer with auto-export options.</p>
<p>Bonus! Upsell the persistent sandbox storage to power users or to support short-term project development.</p>
<p>Or, at the very least, send users a warning that their environment is about to expire and all their files will disappear.</p>
<h2><strong>💬 Useless Messages, Real Frustration</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT error messages are… vague, at best. They don’t give users any real insight into what’s gone wrong, how to fix it, if it even can be fixed, or what to do next. Should you retry or just cry into your keyboard?</p>
<h2><strong>Most Common Vague Error Messages</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“Something went wrong.”
</strong>Seems to cover everything from server glitches to browser issues, but doesn’t explain <em>what</em> went wrong or <em>why</em>.</p>
<p><strong>“A network error occurred.”</strong> / <strong>“An error occurred while connecting to the websocket.”
</strong>This error blames your connection, but follow-up questions to ChatGPT often suggest the root cause is server-side or tool-related.</p>
<p><strong>“There was an error generating a response.”
</strong>ChatGPT tried, failed, and left you guessing what happened.</p>
<p><strong>“Download failed” / “File Not Found.”
</strong>Fairly self-explanatory, but not helpful when it’s actually interface lag or expired file links.</p>
<p>And then there are the oft-repeating <strong>🛠</strong><strong>Code Interpreter-Specific Issues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Code interpreter session expired.”
</strong>Apparently signals that your Python sandbox timed out or reset, but doesn’t say <em>when</em>, <em>why</em>, or <em>how</em> to recover.</p>
<p><strong>“It looks like there was a resource error while trying to open the file”</strong> or <strong>“The environment reset, so …”
</strong>These appear in user reports and feel vague at best or cryptic at worst.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m having technical issues generating your document.”
</strong>Usually happens after a hidden reset; users report seeing this when a session expires unexpectedly.</p>
<p><em>Every one of these errors:</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Leaves the user in the dark</em></strong><em>—no “why,” no “what to do next.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Breaks trust</em></strong><em>—especially when combined with disappearing work or workspaces.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Invites frantic recovery behavior</em></strong><em>, like constant saving, refreshes, or jumping between tabs (as per reddit workaround stories).</em></p>
<p><strong>Quick Fix:</strong> </p>
<p>Tell the user what happened and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Example: “Code interpreter session expired. Restarting will erase uploaded files. Please export now or click ‘Restore Session.’”</p>
<p>Better yet, for the Code interpreter session errors, extend the session timeout length!</p>
<p><strong>SIDEBAR</strong></p>
<p><strong>💸 $20 → $200?! That’s Not Pricing—That’s Ludicrous Speed</strong></p>
<p>The leap from $20 to $200/month is not just steep, it’s absurd. That’s a <strong>10x</strong> jump with no middle tier, no feature scaling, and no nod to solo users or lean teams. (And no, hiding the pricing page behind login walls doesn’t make it feel more premium; it just makes it harder to trust.)</p>
<p>Most users don’t need enterprise—just advanced.</p>
<p>Most orgs won’t pay $200/head for a still-developing tool. (Or even a fully developed one in some cases.)</p>
<p>Are we getting 10x the value? Or just 10x the confusion?</p>
<p>It’s not at all clear what we’re getting that’s worth 10x as much.</p>
<p><em>Most users don’t need a seat at the boardroom table; they just want a better seat in their kitchen.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Strategy Matters (Or, How to Win Customers and Influence Users)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>💡 The Curse of Genius Products</strong></h2>
<p>Lots of great products have been the technical pinnacle of their arena and still had their asses handed to them. Let’s all hope OpenAI doesn’t follow this pattern.</p>
<p>Betamax vs VHS</p>
<p>Google+ vs Facebook</p>
<p>HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray</p>
<p>Nook vs. Kindle (arguable, admittedly)</p>
<p>Power and technical superiority don’t beat usability. Clarity and adoption do.</p>
<p><em>(Unless you’re Oracle. Then you just win through attrition, fear, and sunk-cost Stockholm syndrome.)</em></p>
<h2><strong>❌ What OpenAI Is Getting Wrong</strong></h2>
<p>Prioritizing fear of misuse over user empowerment.</p>
<p>Shipping without full workflows in mind.</p>
<p>Launches with no context, and no clear ownership.</p>
<p>Pricing tiers that alienate mid-level and power users.</p>
<h2><strong>⚠️ Why This Matters Now</strong></h2>
<p>The AI race is still in its early days, and right now it’s about trust, workflow fit, and user loyalty. It’s still anybody’s game.</p>
<p>A brilliant tool nobody wants to <em>use</em> is a demo, not a product.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, a brilliant tool enterprises won’t adopt is a niche market standout, not a long-lasting worldwide phenomenon.</p>
<h2><strong>✅ What Winning Looks Like</strong></h2>
<p>Cross-functional product management teams that understand both AI and human behavior. (And ideally corporate and finance-driven thinking.)</p>
<p>Transparent, iterative design with opportunities for user feedback.</p>
<p>Power features for power users—without dumbing things down for everyone else.</p>
<p>Remember, the early adopters and power users will drive usage because they will sing praises to the rooftops, the neighbors, that creepy guy at the grocery store, and everyone else in earshot. But only if you can convince them you’re giving them something they need that’s better than all the other options.</p>
<p><em>(Don’t believe me? I once convinced my physical therapist to write me a surgery recommendation letter by suggesting she do it in ChatGPT. She did. I got the surgery approved. Just saying…)</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Best AI Doesn’t Win. The Best Product Does.</strong></h2>
<p>ChatGPT won’t fail because it isn’t smart enough. But it might fail because the people behind it are too focused on model performance and not focused enough on how actual humans use tools.</p>
<p>OpenAI won’t lose because of smarter products from Google or Microsoft. But it’s risking irrelevance at the hands of <em>simpler, dumber tools</em> that just work better in context.</p>
<p>If they want to succeed long-term—not just as a research darling, but as an indispensable part of people’s everyday workflows—they need to start shipping grown-up, user-ready products designed to meet their customers where they live.</p>
<p><strong>You’re not losing to smarter competition. You’re losing by default.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t about beating better products. It’s about not beating yourself. You’ve already built what everyone else is chasing. Now ship it like you mean it. Or don’t, and watch Clippy win.</p>
<p>(<em>P.S. Dear Anthropic, If you disagree, call me! </em>😏)</p></div>
