<h1>⚖️ The Skinny: How DEI Leaves Out the Most Visible People</h1>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>TL;DR: DEI talks the talk, but fat folks still walk alone and mocked.</summary>
<ul>
  <li>🪞 <strong>You’re not imagining it.</strong> Fat bias is real, systemic, and still one of the last “acceptable” prejudices.</li>
  <li>⚖️ <strong>The system is rigged.</strong> We’re biologically and culturally outgunned by food engineered for addiction. And then blamed for the outcome.</li>
  <li>👩‍💼 <strong>DEI (and everyone else) forgot us.</strong> Fat people exist in the workforce, but weight bias is rarely acknowledged in inclusion efforts.</li>
  <li>💼 <strong>Stigma costs careers.</strong> Fat workers are paid less, promoted less, and judged more&mdash;often for being “unprofessional.”</li>
  <li>📉 <strong>Wellness ≠ support.</strong> Corporate wellness programs focus on optics, not accessibility, equity, or real help.</li>
  <li>🎭 <strong>Perform or disappear.</strong> Fat folks are expected to be entertaining or invisible. There’s rarely room for just being.</li>
  <li>🎬 <strong>Sidekicks only.</strong> Media casts fat characters as jokes, not leads. And DEI efforts in Hollywood barely touch size bias.</li>
  <li>🥗 <strong>Addiction meets expectation.</strong> Food addiction is real. You can’t go sober from eating. But you’re still expected to behave like you could.</li>
  <li>🪑 <strong>We deserve a seat.</strong> You don’t have to celebrate obesity to stop punishing it. Inclusion means everyone, not just the photogenic few.</li>

<p>Hi. I'm Jenifer. And I love to eat.<br />
<em>Crowd responds:</em> Hi Jenifer.</p>
<p>I have struggled with obesity for most of my adult life. Both of my parents have struggled with being overweight. Both of my step-parents have struggled with it. My ex-husband struggled with it. My siblings have to fight it. Grandparents. Cousins. Aunts and uncles. It's in my family, and it's just a fact. I weighed in at well over 400 pounds at one point. (Happily that time has passed, but it was brutal.)</p>
<p>I know what it feels like to be slender and have people look at you in admiration. I also know what it's like to have people side-eye you like you're too awful to take in with a full gaze.</p>
  <p>For clarity, my experience with being admired was before I got fat. Not since I've gotten smaller. I'm not nearly small enough to feel that kind of look again.</p>
  <p>As a teenager, I was very girl-next-door cute. I was short with big blue eyes, blonde hair and curves for days. I remember being 16, eyeing myself in a size 6 bikini and sighing that I was fat.</p>
  <p>Ha! I had no idea...</p>
  <p>Ten years later I was avoiding the mirror in an oversized sweatshirt and jeans and whining that I was fat. I still had no idea...</p>
  <p>Fifteen years after that... I finally got a clue. I was clocking in around 370 pounds (still not my heaviest), and I basically avoided ever looking at myself in the mirror below the neck.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t shame, exactly. It was distance. Like I’d made some quiet truce with my reflection&mdash;as long as we didn’t look each other in the eye. As long as I didn't look <em>myself</em> in the eye.</p>
  <p>And that worked in a way. For a while.</p>
  <p>Until it didn't.</p>
  <p>Because at some point, I started asking a different question. Not <em>Why am I like this?</em><br />
   But <em>Why are so many of us like this?</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>➕ A Nation of Plus</h2>
<p>Let’s be real: obesity is common. In the U.S., it affects over 40% of adults. Add in those considered overweight but not “obese,” and we’re talking about the majority of the population.</p>
<p>This isn’t a personal failure. It’s a cultural pattern.</p>
<p>We live in a society that practically engineers weight gain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fast food is often cheaper and more accessible than fresh ingredients</li>
      <li>Portion sizes are cartoonishly large by global standards</li>
      <li>Work schedules leave no time for meal planning, movement, or rest</li>
      <li>"Wellness" products are expensive, confusing, and often sold with shame as the motivator</li>
      <li>Marketing campaigns push hyper-processed snacks as comfort, reward, or self-care</li>
      <li>And sugar? It’s in everything&mdash;including things marketed as “healthy”</li>
    </ul>
<p>And then that same culture turns around and says:<br />
<em>How could you let this happen to yourself?</em></p>
  <p>It hands you the tools of self-destruction, watches you use them, and then judges you for the results.</p>
  <p>So yes. Willpower matters. So does personal responsibility.<br />
     But willpower without education, support, and realistic alternatives is a setup.<br />
     It’s asking people to win a fight with one hand tied behind their back&mdash;and then blaming them when they lose.</p>
  <p>Because the truth is, this culture shovels self-destruction down your gullet, watches you choke it down, and then sneers.</p>
  <p>It’s about living in a system where <strong>being fat is both the expected outcome and the unforgivable offense.</strong></p>
  <p>It’s not that willpower doesn’t matter.<br />
   It’s that <strong>we treat it like it should be enough&mdash;and then build a world where it’s constantly outmatched.</strong></p>
  <p>And part of that world?<br />
   It's food that’s designed to outcompete your instincts.</p>
  <p>We’ve been trained&mdash;literally conditioned&mdash;to crave things that barely qualify as food:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oversalted</li>
      <li>Overgreasy</li>
      <li>Overprocessed</li>
      <li>Chemically tweaked to light up our taste buds and shut down our satiety</li>
    </ul>
  <p>It’s not just that broccoli isn’t as fun as fries. (Although I absolutely believe that's true.)<br />
 It’s that your brain has been taught to see broccoli as punishment and fries as reward.</p>
    <p>This isn’t accidental. It’s engineered. Hyperpalatable food is built in labs to override your natural signals &mdash; so you keep eating it. Keep buying it. Keep craving it.</p>
    <p>And then society turns around and says, <em>“Well, just eat healthier.”</em><br />
   As if you weren’t biologically outgunned from the start. After all, when's the last time you saw a commercial for kale?</p>
<hr />
<h2>🎭 The Performative Performance Review</h2>
    <p>I think it all really hit me the day my manager called me into her office to have a deep heart-to-heart about my "health."</p>
    <p>She closed the door. Sat me down. Used that soft, serious tone people use when they’re about to deliver something they think is kind but is actually deeply offensive.</p>
    <p>She said she was concerned about me. Worried about my energy level. About my future.</p>
    <p>She said she wanted me to be around a long time.</p>
    <p>And in the kindest voice, she told me that she thought I should really consider doing something about my weight.</p>
    <p>As if my body was a medical liability. As if my size made me a ticking time bomb.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t asking for help. I wasn’t sick. I wasn’t missing deadlines or failing to deliver.<br />
     I was just... fat. And she thought that gave her the right&mdash;and the duty&mdash;to bring it up.</p>
    <p>She framed it like support. Like compassion.<br />
     But it wasn’t. It was fear wrapped in concern.<br />
     <strong>Bias wrapped in wellness.</strong></p>
    <p>Can you imagine if she'd pulled aside someone to talk kindly to them about their missing limb or diabetes?</p>
    <p>What she was really saying was: <em>“Your body makes me uncomfortable, and I need a professional excuse to address it.”</em></p>
    <p>And you know what made it worse?</p>
    <p>I didn't say anything. I just sat there nodding. Agreeing. Taking in it like it was helpful feedback instead of a gut punch.</p>
    <p>Because some part of me&mdash;the same part this world had been shaping for years&mdash;thought she was right.</p>
    <p>That’s what this kind of stigma does.<br />
     It doesn’t just exist around you. It moves in and takes up residence in your self-worth.<br />
     It teaches you to expect these conversations.<br />
     To feel grateful they didn’t come with outright cruelty.<br />
     To smile politely while someone suggests, gently, that your value as a person might be conditional.</p>
    <p>I left that meeting feeling like I should apologize.<br />
     Not for being unhealthy. Not for needing help.<br />
     But for being visible.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>🧩 Diversity and Inclusion for (Almost) Everyone</h2>
<p>So I did what a lot of people do: I swallowed it. Just one more bite to force down, right?</p>
<p>I tried to move on. Focused on the work.</p>
    <p>That wasn't the first time I'd been gently "encouraged" to be different. To be smaller. It was the first time someone had dared to do it in a professional setting. But what stuck with me was that it echoed something bigger. Something systemic.</p>
<p>I watched DEI programs expand. Slowly, then rapidly.</p>
<p>Conversations that once felt taboo started showing up in onboarding sessions, leadership trainings, mission statements.</p>
<p>I saw companies begin to acknowledge the ways race, gender, orientation, age, and ability shape people’s experiences in the workplace. I saw them roll out initiatives to support transgender employees, reevaluate hiring practices, and build pipelines for underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>And don’t get me wrong. <strong>That’s good. That’s progress.</strong><br />
 Those efforts matter. They’re necessary. They’re long overdue.</p>
<p>But through all of that?</p>
<p>Not once have I seen a DEI initiative include weight.</p>
<p>Not once have I heard a training acknowledge that fat stigma exists in hiring.<br />
 Or that body size can impact promotion, leadership opportunities, or how seriously someone is taken in a meeting.<br />
 Not once have I heard someone say out loud that the “right cultural fit” often means “thin.”</p>
<p>Fat people are everywhere in the workforce.<br />
 We’re here, showing up, leading, building, delivering.<br />
 But when it comes to equity?</p>
<p><strong>We're still invisible.</strong></p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Fat Bias Is a Career Killer (and Still Not in Your DEI Training)</h2>
    <p>Even after companies adopt bigger, more inclusive DEI efforts, <strong>weight may remain invisible</strong> &mdash; yet its impact is measurable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A 2007 U.S. study of over 2,800 people found that overweight adults were <strong>12 times more likely</strong> to report employment discrimination than thinner peers. And those with obesity reported discrimination at <strong>37 times the rate</strong> (Source: <a href="https://uconnruddcenter.org" target="_new">uconnruddcenter.org</a>).</li>
    <li>Other national surveys show that weight-based stigma &mdash; triggered by judgments like laziness or lack of self-control &mdash; is <strong>as common as racial discrimination</strong> in the workplace (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org</a>).</li>
  </ul>
<p>Think about that. It's as common as racial discrimination, but you've never heard it mentioned in a DEI initiative.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>According to SHRM (2023), <strong>50% of people managers</strong> say they prefer interacting with employees of <strong>“healthy weight</strong>,” and <strong>12% of U.S. workers</strong> report having felt unfairly treated due to weight (Source: <a href="https://shrm.org" target="_new">shrm.org</a>).</li>
      <li>Weight stigma cuts deeper for women: obese women are more likely to be paid less, overlooked for hire, or deemed unsuited for roles requiring interaction, while men don’t experience the same penalties (<a href="https://glamour.com" target="_new">glamour.com</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is still happening today. This is not a fluke. It's a pattern.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimates suggest obese women lose between <strong>2.3% and 6.1% of wages</strong>, while obese men may see a <strong>0.7%–3.4% dip annually</strong> &mdash; just for being fat, all things being equal (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org</a>).</li>
      <li>And discrimination persists outside hiring too&mdash;<strong>54% of overweight workers</strong> and <strong>43% of obese workers</strong> report stigma from colleagues or superiors, including jokes, exclusion, or unfair treatment (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, these stats show how bias isn’t hypothetical. It’s a measurable, ongoing structural barrier. When DEI ignores an identity that affects a <strong>large portion of the population</strong>, the gap between appearance and inclusion widens. And careers suffer in the silence.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🪞 Beauty Is a Rigged Game</h2>
<p>So being fat can. hurt your career. Let’s not pretend this issue is just about health.</p>
<p>Because it’s not.</p>
<p>It’s also about beauty. About who’s allowed to be seen, admired, celebrated. And who’s told to shrink themselves out of sight.</p>
<p>From an early age, we’re bombarded with one narrow vision of attractiveness: thin, toned, symmetrical, young. We're shown Barbie dolls and super models and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition like it's the only thing we should ever strive for.</p> 
<p>Anything outside of that &mdash; fat, aging, disabled, or just human &mdash; is treated like a flaw to fix or hide. </p>
<p>These standards aren’t just unrealistic. They’re <strong>manufactured</strong>. Fashion magazines, movie casting, social media filters, celebrity trainers, weight loss endorsements... it’s a billion-dollar industry built on the idea that your body is a problem. And they’ve got the solution.</p>
<p>No wonder we internalize it. No wonder we think we <em>should</em> feel ashamed. That we should be trying harder. That we don’t deserve admiration, visibility, kindness, or love until we meet the quota for thinness. That if we don't match that idea of <em>perfect</em>, then maybe we shouldn't be seen at all.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: that finish line keeps moving. Even thin people feel like they’re not thin enough. Even models face criticism and retouching. And even if you do manage to be thin enough, you will likely have some other feature that's not the social ideal of beauty.</p>
<p>It's not about being healthy.<br />
 It's about being palatable.</p>
    <p>And that’s not <em>your</em> failing.<br />
 That’s the system working exactly as designed.</p>
    <p>We blame individuals for what is, at least in part, a system-wide setup. And then, when those individuals try to fight back? We make it harder still.</p>
 <hr />
<h2>🍕 You Can’t Quit Food</h2>
<p>For those of us who struggle the most, it goes beyond willpower. It becomes addiction. I opened this blog post with a framing we're all familiar with from TV, movies, or maybe meetings. We have fully supported systems to help people deal with drug and alcohol addictions, gambling addiction, sex addiction. You don't see many meetings for Eaters Anonymous, but food addiction is real.</p>
<p>If I were addicted to alcohol, I could go sober. If I were addicted to pills, I could cut them off entirely. But food? You still have to eat. Every single day, you have to face food. The only way to go cold turkey on food is to make a sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. (It's a Dad joke. So sue me.)</p>
<p>Food addiction often gets dismissed or mocked. People think you’re just greedy, not “really” addicted. I mean, how do you get addicted to something everyone has every day? But any addict will tell you that addiction isn't just physical. Neither is hunger. It’s emotional, psychological, and socially reinforced (celebrations, comfort, reward). Just say no isn't an option, and you're constantly surrounded by temptation.</p>
<p>Imagine an alcoholic being told to take three sips of whiskey a day. No more. That’s what eating with food addiction can feel like.</p>
<p>In addition, for many people (both obese and not obese), their first coping mechanism, developed in childhood, for dealing with stress or emotional pain is food. We even call it "comfort food." Carbs release endorphins and serotonin into your system, triggering pleasure and happiness. Most <strong>refined carbs</strong> (sugars, white flours) cause even stronger spikes, and it all makes you feel better. For a little while, anyway.</p>
    <p>And yet, despite all of this &mdash; despite the biochemical triggers, emotional wiring, and constant exposure &mdash; we still treat people like they should just “try harder.” As if knowing broccoli is good for you makes it taste better than fries. As if willpower alone can rewrite decades of conditioning and cultural sabotage.</p>
<hr />
  <h2>⋘⋙ Too Much or Not Enough</h2>
<p>Fat people are often the biggest personalities in the room. Not because we’re naturally louder, funnier, bolder, or more charismatic, but because we’ve learned <em>we have to be</em>. If we’re not <em>more</em>, we risk being ignored entirely. </p>
<p>Or worse, openly disdained.</p>
<p>We become entertainers, caretakers, overachievers. Anything to compensate. Anything to say:<br />
 “I know I’m taking up space. Let me earn it.”</p>
<p>It can even be an internal message we give ourselves to feel better. We tell ourselves, "It's okay that I take up this much space. I'm funny, so I'm allowed!" But it’s exhausting, always trying to be the funniest person in the room just to be invited to stay.</p>
<p>You see it in media, too. Think Melissa McCarthy in her earlier roles &mdash; always the outrageous, over-the-top sidekick. You laugh <em>with</em> her so you aren't laughing <em>at</em> her.<br />
Don’t get me wrong: she’s hilarious and insanely talented. If anyone was ever going to play me in the story of my life, she'd be my first choice! But the roles? They rarely gave her the nuance or depth of her thinner co-stars. Her job was to steal scenes, not to carry them. At least not until she started doing it on her own terms.</p>
<p>That’s the deal fat people often get: be entertaining enough that people forget you don’t “fit.”</p>
    <p>And for those who don’t&mdash;or can’t&mdash;play that larger-than-my-ass role? The pressure doesn’t go away. It just flips.</p>
