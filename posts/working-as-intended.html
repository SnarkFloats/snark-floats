<summary>TL;DR: Understanding the System Doesn't Save You From It</summary>
<ul>
  <li>🧍‍♀️ Still Standing, But Not Okay: I show up, do the work, and hit the goals. The reward? Becoming invisible. Exhaustion without acknowledgment.</li>
  <li>⚙️ High Performance = Disappearing Act: If you’re competent, you get ignored. If you struggle, you get punished. There’s no safe space in between.</li>
  <li>🧠 When Trust Fails Internally: It’s not just the system around you. It’s your brain, your body, and your sense of purpose turning against you.</li>
  <li>🔇 Burnout by Design: The structure is optimized for silence. For invisibility. For extraction. You’re expected to break quietly and leave no mess behind.</li>
  <li>🪞 You Start to Believe Them: When you’ve been dismissed, ignored, and overlooked long enough, you stop pushing back. The system doesn’t even have to gaslight you &mdash; you’ll do it to yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me be clear:<br />
This isn’t a dramatic resignation letter.<br />
This isn’t a sudden breakdown.<br />
This is something quieter. Slower. The emotional equivalent of <strong>erosion</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn’t wake up one morning and hate my job.<br />
I didn’t flip a switch and go from motivated to miserable.<br />
I just... started shrinking.</p>
<p>This isn’t burnout. Or maybe it is. But it’s also just the cost of functioning inside a system that rewards quiet compliance and punishes anyone who dares to care too loudly.</p>
<p>One overloaded calendar day at a time.<br />
One more pointless meeting at a time.<br />
Another performance of “sure, I can take that on” when I couldn’t even remember the last time I felt up to taking <em>anything else</em> on.</p>
<p>It’s not because I can’t do the work. It’s not because I can’t function and be successful at my job.<br />
It's not even that I don't want to work anymore.<br />
I just don’t want to do <em>this</em> anymore. I just don’t care anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve written about the system before. More than once.<br />
About how it fails us.<br />
How it controls us.<br />
How it punishes creativity and rewards compliance and performance.<br />
How it chews through human potential with a smile and a dashboard report.</p>
<p>But here’s the part I haven’t said until now:</p>
<p>Even when you see the system clearly &mdash; even when you can name the patterns, predict the failures, trace the control mechanisms &mdash; you’re still not safe from it.<br />
Because the system doesn’t need you to believe in it.<br />
It just needs you to keep going through the motions.</p>
<p>And I’ve kept going.</p>
<p>Every day I show up on time. I attend endless hours of  meetings where I have nothing to contribute and very little gets accomplished. I respond to Slack and Teams messages from people who always want answers I don’t have, but am expected to somehow pull out of my ass on demand.
</p>
<p>I spend my days building PowerPoint decks that cater to big egos with bigger salaries who don’t really care what I have to say, but insist on the performance anyway.</p>
<p>In short?<br />
I show up.<br />
I do the work.<br />
I answer the emails.<br />
I write the Jira tickets.<br />
I join the calls.<br />
I plan the roadmap.</p>
<p>I crack the jokes.<br />
I mute the despair.</p>
<p>And the system applauds.</p>
<p>It calls me high-performing.<br />
Reliable.<br />
Resilient.<br />
“Strong change management skills.”<br />
"Great attitude under pressure."</p>
<p>But what it really means is: <strong>I haven’t resisted loudly enough to get flagged.</strong><br />
I’m still functioning, which means the machine doesn’t care if I’m falling apart inside.<br />
It doesn’t care if the joy is gone.<br />
It doesn’t care if I fantasize about quitting every single day and then panic because I can’t afford to.</p>
<p>It just cares that I’m still <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>Still producing.<br />
Still measurable.<br />
Still pretending “fine” is a complete emotional experience.<br />
That it doesn’t really mean: Fucked Up. Insecure. Neurotic. Emotional.</p>
<p>This isn’t burnout.<br />
This is a <strong>slow agonizing spirit death by a thousand compliance cuts</strong>.</p>
<p>I don’t hate my coworkers. Most of them are just as trapped as I am.<br />
Hell, a couple of them are people I genuinely care for.<br />
I don’t even hate the work, not really.<br />
What I hate is how the system turns meaning into metrics.<br />
How it takes people who care and bleeds them dry with politeness and policy and KPIs and PowerPoints.</p>
<p>I can’t afford to quit right now.<br />
I can’t afford to rest, either.</p>
<p>So I’m caught in the space between exhaustion and survival, where the only real act of rebellion is saying:
</p>
<p><strong>This is breaking me.</strong><br />
Every day it breaks me a little bit more.<br />
And it’s not okay.<br />
Even if it’s working as intended.</p>
<p>I said at the start this wasn’t a dramatic resignation letter.<br />
It still isn’t.<br />
This isn’t a sudden breakdown.</p>
<p>But it might be a cry for help.<br />
A plea for understanding.<br />
A scream of rebellion.<br />
Maybe just a question?<br />
How did we let it get this way?</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong> did we let it get this way?</p>
