    <h2 id="main-characters">Main Characters</h2>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Commander Shepard – <span class="actor-name">Dichen Lachman</span></h3>
      <p>Commanding, emotionally layered, quietly devastating presence. Hot as hell.<br>Because my Shepard is ALWAYS female. Sorry dudes.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Kaidan Alenko – <span class="actor-name">Steven Yeun</span></h3>
      <p>Grounded, sensitive, morally centered. He carried TWD for 6 seasons with his warmth, and I just know he can warm up space, too.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Ashley Williams – <span class="actor-name">Jessica Henwick</span></h3>
      <p>Military tough, potential for real growth. I don't always love Ashley, but I think I could if she were played by Jessica.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Garrus Vakarian – <span class="actor-name">Jensen Ackles</span></h3>
      <p>Snarky, loyal, emotional backbone, sniper energy. And I suspect he could even make a blue alien with mandibles sexy.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Urdnot Wrex – <span class="actor-name">Idris Elba</span></h3>
      <p>Voice of a god, presence of kings, tired warlord energy and RAGE. I mean... duh?</p>
    </article>     
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Tali'Zorah – <span class="actor-name">Kristen Bell</span></h3>
      <p>Charming, emotionally rich, quirky but brave &mdash; the perfect blend of warmth and wit. I struggled to find anyone else who might even compete for the role.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Liara T'Soni – <span class="actor-name">Dakota Fanning</span></h3>
      <p>Cerebral, vulnerable, terrifying when unleashed. She can go from naive bookworm to galaxy-spanning intel wizard believably.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Jeff "Joker" Moreau – <span class="actor-name">Robert Sheehan</span></h3>
      <p>Sarcastic, fast-talking, emotionally sincere under layers of snark. And weirdly likable despite all that.</p>
    </article>
     <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Admiral Anderson – <span class="actor-name">Viola Davis</span></h3>
      <p>Gravitas, mentorship, emotional foundation, and strength. The first of my gender swaps, and there aren't many. But this one sang to me.</p>
    </article>
     <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Dr. Karin Chakwas – <span class="actor-name">Diane Lane</span></h3>
      <p>Steady, warm, world-weary caregiver. Chakwas is an emotional touchstone in most of my playthroughs, and Diane Lane can definitely pull that off.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Donnel Udina – <span class="actor-name">Giancarlo Esposito</span></h3>
      <p>Slippery, smug, political creature you love to hate. Or maybe just hate. Either way, Giancarlo can NAIL him.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>EDI – <span class="actor-name">Jodie Comer</span></h3>
      <p>Evolving as we watch, dry wit, emotion emerging from logic. This will be a tough role to play, but I think Jodie can pull it off.</p>
    </article>   
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Miranda Lawson – <span class="actor-name">Emily Blunt</span></h3>
      <p>Cool competence, icy exterior with hidden emotional depth. Many people wanted Emily for Shepard, and I could've gotten behind that. But I think this is the role where she'd really shine.</p>
    </article>  
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Jacob Taylor – <span class="actor-name">David Ajala</span></h3>
      <p>Earnest, strong, principled, heart in the right place... Behind his abs. I think he'd make Jacob more lovable. Plus he has melty eyes to die for.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Mordin Solus – <span class="actor-name">Doug Jones</span></h3>
      <p>Physically expressive, voice-flexible, deeply tragic. It was kinda a no-brainer. Did you see him in Star Trek: Discovery?</p>
    </article>  
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Samara / Morinth – <span class="actor-name">Angela Bassett</span></h3>
      <p>Justicar dignity, lethal calm, stoic power wrapped in hotness. I just don't think this kind of feminine power could be played by just anyone.</p>
    </article>  
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Jack – <span class="actor-name">Saoirse Ronan</span></h3>
      <p>Trauma manifest, chaotic, emotionally raw and dangerous. I wanted someone who could be the walking chaos and rage that is Jack but still be likable.</p>
    </article>    
     <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Thane Krios – <span class="actor-name">Dev Patel</span></h3>
      <p>Poetic, spiritual, deadly, a penitent soul in conflict. Who can be all of that and still come across as kinda sexy?</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Grunt – <span class="actor-name">Alan Ritchson</span></h3>
      <p>Literally bred to fight, over-the-top, sweet rage monster. I mean, that's kinda a description of Ritchson as Reacher, isn't it?</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Legion – <span class="actor-name">Stanley Tucci</span></h3>
      <p>Learning to be a person, restrained wonder, unexpected depth. He can show us the tin man becoming real with only a few words.</p>
    </article>   
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Zaeed Massani – <span class="actor-name">Karl Urban</span></h3>
      <p>Veteran merc, feral dad energy, grizzled and hilarious. This one might be a tad controversial, but I see Zaeed as an older space version of Urban's character in The Boys.</p>
    </article>    
     <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Kasumi Goto – <span class="actor-name">Karen Fukuhara</span></h3>
      <p>Playful, stealthy, deadly, rogue energy with heart and a dash of heartbreak. And cute as a button, to boot!</p>
    </article>    
     <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>The Illusive Man – <span class="actor-name">Keanu Reeves</span></h3>
      <p>Cold charisma, tragic idealism, chilling delivery. This role begs for someone likable, because his intentions are good even if his methods are awful.</p>
    </article>   
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Harbinger – <span class="actor-name">Shohreh Aghdashloo</span></h3>
      <p>Cosmic menace. Existential dread. Voice like annihilation wrapped in velvet fire. Her voice deserves a bigger part than Admiral Shala'Ran, so I picked one.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>James Vega – <span class="actor-name">Kevin Alejandro</span></h3>
      <p>Big softie with soldier’s heart, loyal and capable. This was a tough one, but I followed my gut on someone I thought could help James be more than he was in the game.</p>
    </article>  
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Aria T'Loak – <span class="actor-name">Michelle Rodriguez</span></h3>
      <p>Regal ruthlessness, queen of Omega. Hell, she IS Omega. She has to be sexy and unquestionably badass. That pretty much defines Michelle Rodriguez.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Javik – <span class="actor-name">Nonso Anozie</span></h3>
      <p>Ancient strength, commanding presence, disdain turned alliance. Anozie's deep voice, accent and presence seem perfection for this role.</p>
    </article>

    <h2 id="me1-support-cast">ME1 Supporting Cast</h2>
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>Dr. Chloe Michel – <span class="actor-name">Mélanie Laurent</span></h3>
       <p>Calm, competent, trusted. The Normandy’s medbay is in excellent hands if Dr. Chakwas isn't available for... some reason.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>Matriarch Benezia – <span class="actor-name">Gina Torres</span></h3>
       <p>Commanding, elegant, terrifying when cornered; mother, zealot, symbol. Benezia has to wear a lot of hats, and be beautiful and statuesque in all of them.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Nihlus – <span class="actor-name">Sendhil Ramamurthy</span></h3>
      <p>Honorable, intense, mentor energy gone in a tragic flash. Casting Sendhil feels almost like a waste, but he would slay in the role.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Shaira (The Consort) – <span class="actor-name">Claudia Black</span></h3>
      <p>Enigmatic, sensual, wise, with a voice that disarms and devastates. I love her voice, and it's a different role than she acted in the game, so it doesn't break the rules!</p>
    </article>   
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Khalisah Bint Sinan Al-Jilani – <span class="actor-name">Gabrielle Union</span></h3>
      <p>Sharp, persistent, and fearless &mdash; too good at her job for anyone’s comfort</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Chief Engineer Greg Adams – <span class="actor-name">Josh Brolin</span></h3>
      <p>Gruff warmth, capable veteran, zero tolerance for BS. And believable as friendly to just about everyone.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Navigator Charles Pressly – <span class="actor-name">Colin Firth</span></h3>
      <p>Stiff formality hiding a dry wit and eventual loyalty.</p>
    </article>  
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Gianna Parasini – <span class="actor-name">Zendaya</span></h3>
      <p>Corporate investigator with a smile that says, "I’m absolutely arresting you later."</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Emily Wong – <span class="actor-name">Awkwafina</span></h3>
      <p>Relentless, quirky, charming pain in every government’s ass. I overcame my desire to avoid casting any actor with a single name for this one.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Barla Von – <span class="actor-name">John Goodman</span></h3>
      <p>Grumbly gravitas in a tiny pressure suit &mdash; equal parts menace and comic relief.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>Captain Kirrahe – <span class="actor-name">Peter Dinklage</span></h3>
       <p>Vaguely ridiculous deadpan with real inspiration &mdash; "Hold the line!" Not many actors can play serious and ridiculous at the same time.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>Rachni Queen – <span class="actor-name">Kathleen Turner</span></h3>
       <p>Ancient alien intelligence with rich, resonant power and eerie calm. The sound of this one is everything.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
       <h3>Admiral Steven Hackett – <span class="actor-name">Denzel Washington</span></h3>
       <p>Weight of command, with a voice that makes you want to follow orders. Must have presence out the wazoo.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="cast-entry">

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Armando Owen-Bailey – <span class="actor-name">Brian Cox</span></h3>
      <p>Sardonic authority, exhausted competence. He has to exude capability in equal parts with exasperation and disgust.</p>
    </article> 
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Kelly Chambers – <span class="actor-name">Amanda Schull</span></h3>
      <p>Sweet and sincere, but underestimated. This odd role requires an actor who can pull of vaguely bland and traumatized equally well.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Gavin Archer – <span class="actor-name">Gary Cole</span></h3>
      <p>Haunted genius, remorse buried under duty, heartbreaking in his fall. Broken priorities.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>David Archer – <span class="actor-name">Tom Cavanagh</span></h3>
      <p>Fragile, recovering, strange and deeply human. Powerful and terrifying but still sympathetic. That's a tough one.</p>
    </article>    
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Kal'Reegar – <span class="actor-name">Pedro Pascal</span></h3>
      <p>Tough, battle-tested, deadpan with hidden warmth. You believe him as a badass marine who can still make you smile.</p>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Ronald Taylor – <span class="actor-name">Dennis Haysbert</span></h3>

    </article>        
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Tela Vasir – <span class="actor-name">Lashana Lynch</span></h3>
      <p>Relentless, skilled, ruthless with style. One of the tougher fights in ME2, so she had to be played by someone believably badass.</p>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Feron – <span class="actor-name">David Giuntoli</span></h3>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Detective Anaya – <span class="actor-name">Hailee Steinfeld</span></h3>
      <p>Asari C-Sec officer, skeptical and sharp, respectful and dutiful. Ideally stands up even standing next to Samara.</p>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Aresh Aghdashloo – <span class="actor-name">Kirk Acevedo</span></h3>

      <h3>Admiral Zaal'Koris vas Qwib-Qwib – <span class="actor-name">Chiwetel Ejiofor</span></h3>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Admiral Han'Gerrel vas Neema – <span class="actor-name">Lee Pace</span></h3>

    </article>     
    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Admiral Daro'Xen vas Moreh – <span class="actor-name">Michelle Pfeiffer</span></h3>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Kai Leng – <span class="actor-name">Daniel Dae Kim</span></h3>
      <p>Deadly precision, icy calm, intimidating presence. This casting is more about who I think Kai Leng SHOULD be, not who he is in the games.</p>

    <article class="cast-entry">
      <h3>Maya Brooks – <span class="actor-name">Tatiana Maslany</span></h3>

      <h3>Primarch Victus – <span class="actor-name">Samuel L. Jackson</span></h3>

      <p>Right, politically shrewd and stuck defending a crumbling legacy in front of a firing squad. Also has to stand against Wrex, Shepard and Victus without any facial expression, so it had to be someone who oozes gravitas.</p>
