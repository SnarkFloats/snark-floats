    <h1>Snarklevision Presents... <span class="title-highlight">The Mass Effect Dream Cast</span></h1>
  </section>

  <section class="dreamcast-intro">
    <p>I‚Äôve played a lot of games in my time. Dragon Age: Origins is still my personal GOAT &mdash; but when it comes to sheer scope, emotional devastation, and the highest concentration of companions I‚Äôd absolutely die for? The Mass Effect trilogy is my favorite RPG of all time.</p>
    <p>So naturally, the second I heard they were making a live-action adaptation, I started <em>panicking.</em> Not in an excited way. In the "oh no, they‚Äôre going to ruin everything and make Kaidan a leather-jacketed tech bro with three lines per episode" kind of way. Because let‚Äôs be real: adaptations get it wrong approximately 9.9 times out of 10, and Mass Effect is just too damn important to trust to the chaos monkeys in Hollywood.</p>
    <p>That‚Äôs where this list comes in.</p>
    <p>This is my dream cast &mdash; a full, heartfelt, possibly obsessive reimagining of who should be part of a Mass Effect TV series. Not a movie. Not a miniseries. A full-blown, sprawling, multi-season epic with enough time to unpack every heartbreak, loyalty mission, and awkward space flirtation. These actors aren‚Äôt just stunt casting; they‚Äôre chosen because they get the vibe, the nuance, and the soul of this franchise.</p>
    <p>And yes, I cast every major role from ME1 through ME3, plus DLCs. (And a few random walk-ons I happen to like.) Because anything worth doing is worth overdoing.</p>
    <h2>The Rules</h2>
    <p>I gave myself just three rules when I started this project. Okay, that's a lie. I started with more. I gave myself three that I stuck with!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>No casting anyone as a character they voiced in the game. (Sorry Seth Green. ü•π)</li>
      <li>Age doesn't matter too much if it's a role where the face and/or body can't be seen, but if it's a role that requires face- or body-time on camera, they have to be able to pull it off.</li>
      <li>They must be alive. (Yeah, I know...)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The other rules I ditched were ultimately too limiting. For example, you'll note my choices tend to sometimes be a litle older than the character was originally intended to be. I thought about that rule a long time before I ditched it. Let's face it, none of them are really playing their age (given the 105 year old Asari and the likely 1000+ year old Krogan).</p>
    <p>In the end, I chose actors who felt RIGHT to me. Who felt like they fit the character not just in a surface way, but like they could really portray who they are.</p>
    <p>It matters. Because one of the best things about ME is how layered and complex so many of the characters really are. I wanted to honor that.</p>
    <p>I broke the whole thing into four sections.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Main Characters:</strong> these are people we got to know well as companions or recurring enemies, often in more than one game</li>
      <li><strong>ME1 Supporting Cast:</strong> characters who appeared first or mainly in the first game but aren't really main characters</li>
      <li><strong>ME2 Supporting Cast:</strong> showed up first or mainly in the second game but aren't really main characters</li>
      <li><strong>ME3 Supporting Cast:</strong> you guessed it... they showed up in the third game but aren't really main characters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Relay Awaits...</h2>
    <p>So welcome to Snarklevision‚Äôs Mass Effect Dream Cast. Buckle up. Bring snacks. And prepare to argue with me in the comments, because I am right, but I welcome your incorrect opinions anyway. üòè</p>
